*** 3. How long it took you to complete the assignment ***
It took me a few weeks to create the majority of the website as I had to self learn html and css a few months back. 
It took me about three days to adjust the portfolio and solve all the errors that were revealed through the validity and accessibility checkers. 
Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe: Expected a digit but saw % instead
Because width attributes does not use % it uses digits like width='100', means 100px. if you want to apply 100% width on image, use CSS
